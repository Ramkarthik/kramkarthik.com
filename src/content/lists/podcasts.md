These are my current favorite podcasts. I listen to them mostly when I'm doing chores (washing dishes, meal prepping, etc).

### Developer Voices

It's my current, most favorite tech podcast. The host, Kris Jenkins, is knowledgeable and does thorough research. The guests are not limited to a particular topic. You get a wide range of guests that talk about completely different topics. Kris gets right into the topic and they go deep, while still providing high-level details. That is what I like the most about this podcast. It is 100% content and no fluff.

### Local First

I've been reading about the local first architecture recently and that's how I got introduced to this podcast. Johannes Schickling, the host, is also the creator of Prisma. He is one of the influential people in the local first community. The guests are people who are either working on apps that use the local-first approach or are building/researching on the local first approach. The conversation in this podcast also goes deep.
