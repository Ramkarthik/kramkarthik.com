When I start a new side project, I often find myself asking the question: “What tech stack should I use for my side project?”

Over the years, I have found this approach to work the best for me. I ask myself this question: What do I want from this project?

If I want to get it out soon and/or make money from it, I choose the tech stack I’m most comfortable with.

If it is to learn something new, I choose a somewhat unfamiliar stack. I have also found that it works best for me when I limit new parts of the tech stack to maximum two. If there are more than two unfamiliar things, I find it hard to make progress and I give up eventually.

That being said, at the end of the day, I get more done by starting than mulling over what tech stack to use.

If you are reading this, I would love to know how you choose a tech stack for your side projects.
